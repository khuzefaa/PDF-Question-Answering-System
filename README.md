# PDF-Question-Answering-System
The PDF Question Answering System is an intermediate-level Generative AI project that implements a focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for PDF documents. 
What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI technique that combines two key components:

Information Retrieval: Searching through documents to find relevant content based on user queries
Text Generation: Creating human-like responses using the retrieved information as context
Source Attribution: Providing citations and references for transparency and verification

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems can access and reason about specific documents in real-time, making them ideal for document-specific question answering tasks.
